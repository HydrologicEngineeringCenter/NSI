The National Structure Inventory (NSI) provides a base dataset of national coverage of structure points with attributes with consistent quality. The purpose of the NSI databases is to facilitate the assessment and analysis of natural hazards. The NSI describes the exposure and vunerability of the structures of the nation with each point attempting to represent a single structure. Pairing this inventory with hazard information provides a means to evaluate consequences of natural hazards. Flood damage analysis has been the primary usage, but sufficient data exists on each structure to compute damages due to other hazard types.
